The final project for this course was a full website using data stored on our hosted database.

The website was written using PHP and HTML with CSS Style Sheets and hosted using myphpadmin and a database system provided through Clemson University.

The final project can be found on one of my collaborative repositores named jmcdowell294/metubeProject
